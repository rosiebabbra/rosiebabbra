    "paragraphOne": "Hello beautiful! A little bit about me: I live, breathe, and sleep makeup. I started off shadowing local makeup artists at the mere age of 15. I garnered experience working at weddings, boudoir shoots, and local fashion shows. I worked for MAC Cosmetics whilst attending college pursuing a career in the tech industry.",
    "paragraphTwo":"I now split my time between working as a software engineer and as a freelance makeup artist. I have been afforded the opportunity to work with brides, models and actors in the Los Angeles area and beyond. For whatever occasion you're seeking a makeup artist, I can promise that your needs will not only be met, but will be exceeded.",
